# Typhoon_Master

This repository is the official source code for my master graduation thesis which English name is **Research on Typhoon Movement and Intensity Forecasting Based on Deep Learning Method** and Chinese name is **《基于深度学习的台风路径与强度预测方法研究》**. The original paper has been published on CNKI [link](https://kns.cnki.net/kcms/detail/detail.aspx?dbcode=CMFD&dbname=CMFD202101&filename=1020396103.nh&uniplatform=NZKPT&v=Gxr%25mmd2F5KbrxH0arAOtM8YZhrTH6OwZ%25mmd2FiCvi%25mmd2Frk1WftrmbgYT8MN7u%25mmd2FyeTQFBFyL%25mmd2BSP). Many thank to my supervisor [Prof. Yunming Ye](http://faculty.hitsz.edu.cn/yeyunming), [Prof. Xutao Li](http://faculty.hitsz.edu.cn/lixutao), and classmates that ever help me for this research.

This repository is the display website system for both Typhoon Path and Intensity prediction.

To run this website system. Please kindle follow these steps:
* Step 1. Install the requirement environment 
```
conda env create -f Typhoon_Master.yaml
```  
* Step 2. Run the main python file named **app.py**
```
